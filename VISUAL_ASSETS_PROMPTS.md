• Geometric tech accents (hexagons, circuit lines)
• Small cyan energy particles scattered between agents

STYLE:
Modern esports/gaming logo aesthetic.
Tech/cyberpunk visual language with clean geometry.
High contrast, designed for small-size legibility.
Photoshop vector-style rendering with gradient overlays.

COLOR PALETTE (use these exact hex codes):
• Vivid purple: #7C3AED (left agent, glow effects)
• Bright orange: #F97316 (right agent, highlights)
• Electric cyan: #06B6D4 (accents, particles, energy)
• Deep navy: #0F172A (background, dark areas)

CONSTRAINTS:
• Text "AGENT BRAWL" must be perfectly legible at 100px size
• No overlapping between text and central figures
• Maintain sharp edges on all geometric elements
• Glow effects must not obscure main subjects
• Symmetrical balance required (50/50 visual weight)
• All text must render with anti-aliasing for clarity
• Design must remain recognizable when scaled to 48x48px

TYPOGRAPHY:
Font style: Bold futuristic sans-serif (similar to Orbitron or Exo 2)
Text: "AGENT BRAWL" in all caps
Placement: Bottom arc of circular emblem
Text color: White (#FFFFFF) with subtle cyan (#06B6D4) glow
Letter spacing: Slightly expanded for futuristic feel

LIGHTING:

Rule of thirds composition: main title at left third intersection.
Depth layers: foreground agents (sharp) → mid-ground arena → background cityscape (atmospheric).
Visual flow: strong diagonal from bottom-left to top-right suggesting action and movement.

COMPONENTS:
• Title text: "AGENT BRAWL" (large, prominent, left-center)
• Subtitle: "AI Battle Arena" (smaller, below title)
• 3-4 stylized AI agent silhouettes in dynamic combat poses
• Digital arena environment with grid floor
• Energy blasts and particle effects mid-flight
• Holographic UI elements floating in space
• Futuristic cityscape in distant background
• Light beams and volumetric fog for atmosphere

STYLE:
Cinematic gaming banner with AAA video game quality.
Tech/cyberpunk aesthetic meets esports branding.
Dramatic lighting with strong color contrast.
Photorealistic rendering with stylized elements.
Depth of field: sharp foreground, slightly blurred background.

COLOR PALETTE (use these exact hex codes):
• Vivid purple: #7C3AED (left-side lighting, energy effects, title glow)
• Bright orange: #F97316 (right-side explosions, highlights, fire effects)
• Electric cyan: #06B6D4 (holographic UI, tech accents, particles)
• Deep navy: #0F172A (background sky, shadows, depth)
• Black: #000000 (darkest areas for maximum contrast)

CONSTRAINTS:
• "AGENT BRAWL" text must be perfectly legible at all screen sizes
• No visual elements may obscure or overlap the title text
• Maintain clear separation between text and background (use glow/outline)
• All agent silhouettes must be distinguishable and non-overlapping
• Preserve 3:1 aspect ratio exactly (1500x500px)
• Text must remain sharp and anti-aliased
• Color temperature: cool left (purple), warm right (orange)
• Ensure sufficient contrast for text readability on any device

TYPOGRAPHY:
Main title: "AGENT BRAWL"

Purple = strategic AI intelligence and technology.
Orange = explosive action and competitive energy.
Cyan = digital realm and futuristic interface.
Create tension between calm strategy (left) and chaotic action (right).

## Color Reference
- **Purple** (#7C3AED) - Primary brand color, energy effects
- **Orange** (#F97316) - Action, explosions, highlights  
- **Cyan** (#06B6D4) - Tech elements, UI accents
- **Dark Navy** (#0F172A) - Background, depth

## Tips for Nano Banana Pro
- If text isn't perfect on first try, regenerate or ask it to "make the text clearer and more legible"
- You can iterate: "same image but make the purple more vivid"
- Try variations: "generate 4 different versions" 
- For the logo, you might want to try 2-3 versions and pick the best

## After Generation
1. Download both images
2. Logo: Resize to exactly 400x400px if needed
3. Header: Resize to exactly 1500x500px if needed
4. Save them in `brawl/assets/` folder:
   - `logo-400x400.png`
   - `header-1500x500.png`
