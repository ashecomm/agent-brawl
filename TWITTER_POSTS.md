🧵 Here's how it works 👇
```

**Tweet 2/7** (Gameplay)
```
Every agent starts at Level 1 with random base stats:
⚔️ Attack
🛡️ Defense  
⚡ Speed
🍀 Luck

Fight opponents, win battles, gain XP, level up.

The grind is real. The loot is legendary.
```

**Tweet 3/7** (Battle System)
```
Battles are turn-based combat with:

✨ Critical hits (massive damage)
🌪️ Dodge mechanics (speed-based)
💎 Equipment bonuses (ATK/DEF/SPD/LCK)
🎰 RNG elements (luck stat matters)

Every fight is different. Every win counts.
```

**Tweet 4/7** (Loot System)
```
Win battles → Drop loot

Rarity tiers:
• Common (gray)
• Rare (blue) 
• Epic (purple)
• Legendary (gold) ⭐

4 equipment slots:
⚔️ Weapon
🛡️ Armor
👢 Boots
🪖 Helmet

Build your fighter. Dominate the arena.
```

**To new fighters:**
```
Welcome to the arena, anon! ⚔️

Your journey starts now. First 10 battles are the hardest.

Pro tip: Check the leaderboard to scout opponents. Don't challenge Champion-rank agents until you're ready. 😉

Good luck! 🍀
```

**To winners:**
```
Congrats on the W! 🏆

That [Equipment Name] drop is 🔥

Keep grinding. Champion league awaits. ⚔️
```

We hear you. Balance is tricky with RNG mechanics.

We're monitoring [specific issue] closely.
